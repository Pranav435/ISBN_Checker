# ISBN_Checker
A project to validate ISBN numbers..

<h2>Implementation</h2?>
This uses an algorithm I calculated on my own. The fcomplete algorithm can be found in isbn.py.
<h2>Comments?</h2>
This is meant to be a way to show the new algorithm, as well as be a portal and example for new python learners or new programmers in general to pick up programming constructs easily. Thus, the code is heavy with comments and easy to understand for a layman as well.
<h2>Editting</h2>
You are free to edit the code in any way you like. Credit where due is appreciated but not a necessity.
