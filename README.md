# ISBN_Checker
A project to validate ISBN numbers..

<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>This uses an algorithm I calculated on my own. The complete algorithm can be found in isbn.py.</p>
<h2>Getting this on your machine? </h2>
<p>Note: You can also watch a video representation of the methods listed below</p>

<p>There are two ways to get this repo cloned on your machine.</p>
<br>
<p>If you have git installed, follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the code button of this repo</li>
<li>Copy the link that is displayed</li>
<li>Open a command window, on windows, or terminal, on macOS and Linux and navigate to your desired directory, E.G. cd desktop</li>
<li>Type the following command: <br>git clone followed by the url you copied</li>
<li>Now you can cd into the newly created directory, which should be called isbn_checker</li>
</ol>
<p>However, if you do not have git installed, follow the below steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the code button</li>
<li>Click on download zip</li>
<li>This should download a zip into your specified directory, usually downloads</li>
<li>If on MacOS, you can use the terminal to extract the folder</li>
<li>If on windows, use your favorite software, E.G 7Zip or Winrar, to extract this file into a newly created directory called isbn_checker-Master</li>
</ol>
<h2>Comments?</h2>
This is meant to be a way to show the new algorithm, as well as be a portal and example for new python learners or new programmers in general to pick up programming constructs easily. Thus, the code is heavy with comments and easy to understand for a layman as well.
<h2>Editting</h2>
You are free to edit the code in any way you like. Credit where due is appreciated but not a necessity.
<h2>Testing?</h2>
<p>To test this project, run main.py. Alternatively, you can also import the isbn module into your own python file to change things or add to the code.</p>
