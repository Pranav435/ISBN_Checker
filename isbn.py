#the following function, when given an ISBN number, that is, a positive integer which is 13 digits long, will check its validity using the following algorithm
#algorithm:
"""
Step 1. Add up all the odd_positioned digits. That is: odd_total=isbn[0]+isbn[2]+isbn[4]+isbn[6]+isbn[8]+isbn[10]+isbn[12]
Step 2: Add up all the evenly positioned digits, that is, even_total=isbn[1]+isbn[3]+isbn[5]+isbn[7]+isbn[9]+isbn[11], and multiply the result by 3: even_total*=3
Step 3: Add the totals from steps 1 and 2: total=odd_total+even_total
step 4: If the remainder between the total and 10 is 0, then the number is valid. Else, it is not: if total%10==0: True. Else: False.
This happens because the last digit in the number is a check digit. Each ISBN number has a unique check digit that identifies its validity. If the remainder is not 0, then the check digit is invalid, and thus, the ISBN number is invalid.

Input: an ISBN number, that is, a 13 digit non-negative number.
Output: True if the number is valid, False if it is not.

-1: Negative number.
